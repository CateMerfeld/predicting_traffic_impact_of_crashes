## Predicting traffic congestion using environmental crash data

### Background:
Most of us use the mapping software on our phones when we want to avoid traffic. Those softwares determine how to route us using historical traffic data along with real time data from road sensors and phones. The problem with this system is that, by the time sensors and phones in cars start showing traffic slowing enough to reroute other vehicles, a traffic jam has already started.

According to the US DOT, the second leading cause of traffic is crashes, accounting for upwards of 25% of all congestion. A crash during peak driving times can create traffic for hours. I wanted to see if I could make a tool that would use information available at the time of a crash to predict the severity of the traffic impact. 

### Data:
Obtained [here] (https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)
Over 3 million records of crashes from across the US between 2016-2020. Variables include
